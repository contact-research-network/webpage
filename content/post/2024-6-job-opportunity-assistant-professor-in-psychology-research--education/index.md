The Durham Psychology Department got approval to advertise the position of an **Assistant Professor in Psychology** (Research & Education) open to all areas. The post is advertised as ‘open to all areas’ because we currently do not know the exact number of finally approved posts. The outcome of the current planning round will be announced when student numbers are confirmed in autumn. Ideally, we have new academic staff arriving before the start of next academic year. Depending on additional approval of staff requests later this year, we might revisit the shortlist of the current recruitment. The search panel will consist of members from all three research groups.
