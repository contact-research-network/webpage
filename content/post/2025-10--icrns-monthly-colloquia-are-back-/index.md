We are excited to share that we have a new round of wonderful speakers lined up for a brand-new round of the ICRN colloquium! This includes a new section dedicated to the wishes and needs of our early postgraduate researcher community!
  While we are busy getting a few last details organised before we release the full list of speakers and schedule, we would like to announce that *Prof. Jake Harwood, University of Arizona* will kick us off on *Friday, 31st October 2025, 3-4 pm British time.* 
  
  *The rhythm is gonna get you: What people do during contact matters*
  _Jake Harwood, Department of Communication, University of Arizona_
   This talk will discuss the importance of considering “what happens” during intergroup contact. It argues that specific activities that parties engage in during contact have implications for the mechanisms likely to mediate contact’s effects. Experimental studies of indirect contact’s effects will be discussed, including studies focusing on musical activity as a particularly potent platform for intergroup contact. The talk concludes with thoughts on the diversity and complexity of “positive intergroup contact.”
