We invite you to participate in an exciting international meeting -- Peacebuilding through Conflict Transformation: Intraindividual, Interpersonal, Intergroup, and Global Processes – that will be held June 20-22, 2025 in Nonh Chock, Bangkok, Thailand.
  The conference will be hosted by the International Institute for Peace and Development Studies and limited in size (50 participants or less). In this informal and friendly setting, we seek to bring together psychologists interested in deepening their understanding of peacebuilding processes across multiple levels of analysis: ranging from intra-individual processes focused on achieving inner peace, to intergroup processes that seek to ease tensions between social groups, to global processes that seek to promote peacebuilding. Participants will be encouraged to present research findings and share perspectives that speak to how broad-scale conflicts can be transformed through fostering peace at multiple levels. All participants will be lodged at the Institute.
  This event is the latest in the SPSSI-SASP Small Group Conference Series. Along with the Society for Australasian Social Psychology, SPSSI has sponsored small group events addressing: Sustainable Consumption, Intergroup Contact Research, Migration, and Collective Harm-Doing at varied locations on either side of the Pacific: Newcastle, NSW, Denver, CO, Ottawa, CA, Brisbane, QLD, Philadelphia, PA and Melbourne, VIC. 
  The costs of lodging, food, and transportation to and from the Bangkok airport will be covered by the hosts. Participants will need to arrange and pay for their own (international) transportation to Bangkok airport and a nominal conference fee to secure their place upon confirmation of their acceptance.
