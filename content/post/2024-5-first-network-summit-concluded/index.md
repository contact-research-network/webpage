ðŸŒŸ We just completed the **inaugural summit** of the new **international Contact Research Network** - thanks to the amazing colleagues who spent the last 2 days with us in London at Birkbeck!ðŸŒŸ
  
  Our conversations highlighted some priorities and opportunities for future researchðŸ‘‡
  ðŸ’¡Contact interventions can promote understanding in schools (Lindsey), at work (Libby) and in conflict situations (Orkun), and reduce political polarisation (MichÃ¨le).
  ðŸ’¡Contact in everyday life may also promote understanding, yet we need to further explore how to create successful interactions (Stefania, Deborah & Patrick).
  ðŸ’¡There are promising opportunities to use new technologies to promote contact and better intergroup relations - from VR to chatbots (Lukas).
  
  We were particularly excited to also hear from early career researchers who will help shape the future of our research field (Jie, Zackary, Diana, Emine and Ditte).
  
  We struck up various new collaborations and canâ€™t wait to see them play out - and to have further contact researchers join us on the journey ahead.
