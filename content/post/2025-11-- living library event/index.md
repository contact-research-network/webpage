We’re excited to share an upcoming event from the Living Library in the Netherlands. On December 11, they will host an online Living Library session, followed by a symposium discussing new findings on the impact of the Living Library on both disadvantaged and advantaged groups, presented by Afreen, Julia and Fani.
