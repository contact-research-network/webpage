Keon West is a Professor of Social Psychology at Goldsmiths, University of London. 

His research focuses on detecting, understanding, and reducing group-based biases, including bias based on race, gender, religion, immigrant status, mental health, and sexual orientation. Essentially, Keon’s research answers questions like “how are Black and White people treated differently in job applications?”, “how can we reduce anti-immigrant prejudice?”, and “how do we decide if someone is gay or heterosexual?”

Fundamentally international, Keon was born in Trinidad, raised in Jamaica and educated at Macalester (Minnesota, USA), the Sorbonne (Paris, France) and Oxford University (Oxford, UK) under a Rhodes Scholarship. He's served on the governing board of many psychological societies including the British Psychological Society and the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues (a multi-million dollar branch of the APA), for which he served as president from 2020 - 2021.  

A believer in the importance of good science communication, as well as good science, Professor West appears regularly on television and radio as an expert on prejudice reduction. He's also the author of 2 lay books - (1) "Skewed: Decoding Media Bias" published by Howes and currently available on audible and (2) "The Science of Racism", published by MacMillan (UK) and Abrams (USA) with a release date in early 2025.
