# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Nils Reimer uses advanced quantitative methods to answer new questions about intergroup relations, social identity, social injustice, and social change. In past and current work, he investigates how intergroup contact—that is, personal experiences with members of a different social group—affects not only our prejudices, but also our awareness of, and opposition to, social injustice. For example, he studies whether intergroup contact undermines support social change in disadvantaged groups, but also whether intergroup fosters allyship in advantaged groups. In current and future work, he investigates double standards in where people draw the line between acceptable and unacceptable means of effecting social change as well as defensive responding to being confronted with one’s own role in maintaining social injustice. To study these issues, his research uses quantitative methods such as Bayesian data analysis, multilevel models, (longitudinal) structural equation models, meta-analysis, and social network analysis.
