Maria-Therese Friehs is postdoctoral researcher at the work unit for
psychological methods and evaluation at the FernUniversit√§t in Hagen,
Germany. She is a passionate intergroup contact researcher, focussing
mostly on how intergroup contact evolves and affects attitudes over
time, how contact is experienced in everyday life, and how contact
experiences are linked to basic psychological needs. Therese is also
interested in social perception research, mainly concerning the
assessment of stereotypes and prejudice. She enjoys applying advanced
quantitative analytical models and doing longitudinal data analysis and
scale construction. She also did a lot of large-scale secondary data
analysis and re-analyses of published data.

Together with Mathias Kauff and Oliver Christ, Therese is one of the
organizers of the EASP small group meeting on intergroup contact in
Hamburg in August 2024.
