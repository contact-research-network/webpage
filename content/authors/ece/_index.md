# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am a Ph.D. candidate interested in intergroup relations and social identity theory. My specific focus revolves around examining how minority groups manage and adapt to their identities, and the subsequent impact on their self-perception and mental well-being.  To unravel these questions, I use a wide array of methods, including experiments and qualitative research, to attain a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of individual experiences. For my Ph.D. project, I am researching daily racial discrimination and its effects on youths’ mental health, under the supervision of Prof. Baumert and Prof. Kaurin.
