Libby is a Senior Lecturer in the Birkbeck Business School, University of London. She obtained her PhD focused on intergroup contact between age groups from University of Kent in 2017. 

Her research uses quantitative and experimental methods in the laboratory, workplace and online to examine the impact of biases, stereotypes and intergroup relations on individual, organisational and social outcomes. Specific focuses include intergenerational relationships in society (e.g. older retired adults and children) and age-diverse contact and friendships between co-workers. Libby also focuses on ageism and age stereotypes at work.

Libby's research has been funded by The British Academy and Volkswagen Stiftung. In addition to academic publications, Libby's research has been published by Age UK, the British Medical Association and the UK Government Office for Science.
