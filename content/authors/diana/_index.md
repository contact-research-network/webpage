Diana is a PhD student at Royal Holloway, University of London. Her research explores the psychological mechanisms that contribute to transprejudice. Her work aims to understand how factors such as essentialist thinking, strong group identity, and gender distinctiveness threat might influence attitudes towards transgender people. Diana is also interested in how perceiver and target level factors might interact to yield negative attitudes towards transgender people.

Diana is also interested in testing effective processes for transprejudice reduction. This involves investigating whether prejudice reduction mechanisms that have been effective in other forms of prejudice (for example interethnic relations) could be applied to interventions aimed at reducing transprejudice.
