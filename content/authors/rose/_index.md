Rose is an Associate Professor at the University of East Anglia, Norwich. She obtained her PhD in 2013 from the University of Kent. Rose also completed an MSc in Group Processes and Intergroup Relations and a BSc in Psychology at the same institution. 

Her research focuses on prejudice and intergroup relations. She is particularly interested in understanding how intergroup contact works to improve intergroup attitudes in different forms and in different contexts, as well as how the benefits of intergroup contact may extend beyond traditional intergroup outcomes.

Her research has been funded by grants from the Leverhulme Trust and Innovate UK, as well as commercial bodies. She has experience promoting social psychological research to non-academic audiences and has served as an expert panellist at events organised by the UK Parliament and UNESCO. She is an associate editor of Group Processes and Intergroup Relations and an editorial board member at the Journal of Theoretical Social Psychology.
