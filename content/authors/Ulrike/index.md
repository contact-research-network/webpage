# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: "Ulrike is a Full Professor and Head of the Business and Organizational Psychology Chair at the Institute for Education, Work and Society – University of Hohenheim in Stuttgart, Germany. She is also a Visiting Research Fellow at Birkbeck College, University of London, in the United Kingdom. She received her PhD from Leuphana University of Lüneburg and, after, worked at Oxford Brookes University and Justus Liebig University in Giessen. In addition to her academic career, Ulrike has professional experience in the areas of human resources and management consulting.
Next to her research on work and aging, Ulrike studies workplace relationships and diversity management, knowledge transfer and learning, sustainable career development, and organizational behavior, technology and change. Her research is well supported through competitive grants, including the British Academy, the German Research Foundation, the Volkswagen Foundation, and the European Union's COST Action Initiative, and has been published in high-quality journals such as the Journal of Applied Psychology, Personnel Psychology, and Human Relations. In 2021, Ulrike received the Dr. Herbert Stolzenberg Award for her research. With the population aging in many countries across the world, and the associated societal tensions, the topic of work and aging is a very critical one, and her research is making a substantial contribution to this field.
Building on her early work on intergenerational contact in hiring decisions, Ulrike has developed a broader research stream on intergroup contact at work. Her studies show how positive intergroup contact—initially between different age groups in hiring contexts, and later extending to age-diverse workplace friendships—can reduce social tensions, foster cooperation, and support employee well-being and organizational harmony.
Ulrike currently serves as an Associate Editor of the Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, and is on the Editorial Boards of Personnel Psychology, Work, Aging and Retirement, the Journal of Vocational Behavior, Management Review Quarterly, and the Journal of Organizational Behavior."
