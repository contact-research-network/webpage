Islam Borinca is an Assistant Professor of Social and Political Psychology at the University of Groningen, Netherlands. His research explores how different groups interact, focusing on how they help each other, their feelings toward one another, and their behavior in various situations. He also examines intervention strategies that facilitate intergroup contact in contexts where direct interaction is limited, such as in post-conflict and conflict societies. Islam is engaged in international research collaborations and holds several editorial roles, contributing to the advancement of knowledge in intergroup relations and social cooperation.
