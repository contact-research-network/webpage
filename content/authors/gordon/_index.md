Gordon Hodson is a prejudice researcher with a special interest in intergroup contact, friendships, and intimate relationships. His interests include individual differences in contact (e.g., for whom does contact “work”), the cognitive liberalization effects of contact (i.e., tertiary contact effects), among other topics. He has co-edited a volume ([Advances in Intergroup Contact; Hodson & Hewstone, 2013](https://www.routledge.com/Advances-in-Intergroup-Contact/Hodson-Hewstone/p/book/9781848721142)), and published multiple papers, on intergroup contact (see [his Publications](http://www.hodsonlab.com/publications.html)).
