Nicola works as a Lecturer at UCL, Institute of Education. There, she teaches on social and developmental psychology and primarily researches bystander intervention in the context of bullying in schools. 

Nicola is particularly interested in bullying that is biased-based (e.g. based on gender, race and ethnicity, country of origin, sexuality and disability etc.). For example, I am interested in what makes someone feel confident enough to intervene when they witness bullying, especially when the bullying is directed at someone who belongs to a different social group (e.g. they are from a different ethnic background). She is also very interested in mixed methods, knowledge exchange and co-constructed research. 

In 2014, Nicola completed her PhD at the University of Kent. In that research, she focused on how intergroup contact and the theory of planned behaviour could help explain bystander intervention in the context of bullying in U.K. secondary schools.
